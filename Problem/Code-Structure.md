# Computing Part

`run_SOBI.m` is the main function. It consists of two parts, the first part is a Matrix-reader to read data in `DATA.mat`. And then it call `SOBI.m` to calculate all we want.

So our main mission is to convert `SOBI.m` into C++ version and then optimize it.

# Verification Part

All we need to do is to run `result_testing.m` and then we are able to verify our program.
